# Lingvo-mod
A modified fork of [Lingvo](https://github.com/tensorflow/lingvo), with added definitions of AlexNet and VGG16, pipelined with GPipe. (Definitions are present in lingvo/tasks/image). A report with a set of benchmarking experiments containing different configurations of their training performance can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zy5UrCA__mwwAZ18I7ea2I1puxPjhIhX/view?usp=sharing).
